# Hypothesis-Testing-for-Autolib-electric-car-sharing-service


# Problem Statement
We have been tasked to understand electric car usage. We will work as a Data Scientist for the Autolib electric car-sharing service company to investigate a claim about the blue cars from the provided Autolib dataset.

In an effort to do this, we need to identify some areas and periods of interest via sampling stating the reason to the choice of method, then perform hypothesis testing with regards to the claim that we will have made.

# Defining the matrics of success
This project will be considered a success when we are able to perform the following tasks:

Specify the null and alternate hypothesis.
Conduct EDA to uncover underlying patterns within the dataset that can guide the sampling technique.
Perform hypothesis testing and interpret the results.
Provide project summary and conclusions.


# Hypothesis Testing #

Specifying the question
Null Hypothesis: For both Paris and Essonne the average number of blue cars picked up during weekends is the same.
Ho : μ1 = μ2 (where μ1 is the mean for Paris and μ2 is the mean for Essonne)
Alternate Hypothesis: The average number of blue cars picked up during the weekend is not the same for Paris and Essonne.
Ha : μ1 ≠ μ2

# Data Description #
The provided dataset is a daily aggregation, by date and postal code, of the number of events on the Autolib network (car-sharing and recharging). The dataset and glossary to use for this project can be found here [https://bit.ly/DSCoreAutolibDataset

# Technologies Used #
Various Python Libraries

# Usage #
This project demonstrates how various data analysis and statistical tecniques that can be used to perform hypothesis testing and can be replicated on any data science project.
